
Ryacas is an R interface to the free yacas computer algebra
system.  Ryacas allows one to send R expressions,
unprocessed yacas strings and certain other R objects to a
separate yacas process from R and get back the result.  It
also has facilities for manipulating yacas strings and R
expressions destined for yacas processing.

It can be used for exact arithmetic, symbolic math, ASCII
pretty printing and translating R to TeX.
