Changes in version 0.2-5

o srcfile= added to parse call in yacas() and Sys.putenv replaced with
  Sys.setenv so yacas works with R 2.5.0

Changes in version 0.2-4

o new Windows only features
  - yacas.exe, scripts.dat no longer included in Ryacas distribution
  - new Windows-only yacasInstall and yacasFile commands
    to facilitate installation of yacas
  - .First.lib reminds Windows users to install yacas if yacas not found

o Ryacas now uses yacas 1.0.63 on all platforms. (The yacas Windows binary 
  is available in the relevant zip file under Downloads tab on Ryacas 
  home page. On Windows yacasInstall() will download it, extract yacas.exe and
  scripts.dat and place them both in ...\Ryacas\yacdir.)

o yacas is now started in single user server mode (this new mode was added
  to yacas as of yacas version 1.0.62)

o runYacas now uses wait = FALSE on Windows

o fixed bug in yacasInvokeString (it was ignoring init.args)

o fixed latex bug in Sym.Rd

o verbose= argument of yacas command can now take not only TRUE and FALSE
  but also "input" and "output"

o added "yacas" method for the yacas generic

o the two vignettes are combined into one

Changes in version 0.2-3

o Ryacas-Sym vignette fixed

o most .Sym methods have been made .default methods

o Identity, Identity.default added

o new YACAS_INVOCATION_STRING environment variable can be set to
  override the default yacas invocation string.  (It also overrides
  the settings of the other YACAS_ environment variables which are
  only available on Windows.)  Thanks to Simon Blomberg for 
  discovering certain possible startup problems.  This should provide
  a general "out" for these on systems that need it.

o method = "system" in yacas command now works at least on Windows

o yacas method argument defaults to getOption("yacas.method")
  and to "socket" if that is not set.

Changes in version 0.2-2

o bug fixes in R to yacas parser

o added yacas.formula

o new runYacas function

Changes in version 0.2-1

o \dontrun{...} on all examples to avoid Rcmd check problems

o new Ryacas-prettyPrinter demo

Changes in version 0.1-11

o yacas now starts up when the first time the yacas command is given for
  method = "socket" rather than at package startup (or if the user
  explicitly invokes the optional yacasStart() function).

o new yacas method = "system" argument which uses the R "system" command 
  to spawn a new instance of yacas each time yacas is called and so does 
  not require sockets.  The default continues to be method = "socket".

o new command yacasInvokeString which outputs the invocation string for
  yacas (with no trailing &).

o yacasStop has a verbose argument (like yacasStart).

o yacas.character has an addSemi argument that defaults to TRUE.

o WISHLIST updated

Changes in version 0.1-10

o yacas is now a generic with character and expression methods

o added method= argument to yacas (currently unused)

o yacasStop now closes (and on Windows XP Pro kills) yacas.  Previously 
  it was only done on detaching the yacas package.

o minor improvements in help file (more are needed)

Changes in version 0.1-9

o bug fixes

Changes in version 0.1-5

o yacmode function from yacasR added

o yacas.start renamed and yacas.stop renamed to yacasStart and yacasStop.
  yacasStart has a verbose argument that defaults to FALSE.  yacasStart
  is used in the yacas example.

o yacas now has verbose = FALSE by default but returns yac.res

o WISHLIST updated

Changes in version 0.1-4

o taskkill used instead of pskill for Windows.  Now no auxilliary process
  termination utility is used but only XP Pro will get its yacas process 
  terminated on exit.

Changes in version 0.1-3

o yparse and associcated routines added

o windows now kills process using pskill.exe which is included

o ported to UNIX (previously Windows only)

o environment variables YACAS_HOME, YACAS_SCRIPTS and YACAS_INIT can be
  used to override default locations of yacas, scripts.dat and R.ys .
