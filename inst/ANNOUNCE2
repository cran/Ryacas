
This is to announce that Ryacas has moved to the CRAN
(from the Omegahat) repository.

Also a new version of Ryacas is being released: Ryacas 0.2-4.

---

A partial lists of changes is shown here:

o Ryacas 0.2-4 will use yacas 1.0.62 on all platforms.
  (It previously used yacas 1.0.61 on Windows and yacas 1.0.62 
  on other platforms.)

o The binary files 'yacas.exe' and 'scripts.dat' for Windows are 
  no longer included in Ryacas. Instead, a new installation procedure
  has been developed for Windows users only to install both
  Ryacas and yacas:

	install.packages("Ryacas, dep = TRUE)
	library(Ryacas)
	yacasInstall()
 
  On other platforms, as before, its up to the user to separately 
  install yacas 1.0.62 .

o on all platforms yacas now shuts down gracefully when the user 
  detaches Ryacas:

  	detach()

WHAT IS RYACAS?

Ryacas allows R users to access the yacas computer
algebra system (CAS) from R.

Ryacas can be used for exact arithmetic, symbolic
math, ASCII pretty printing and translating R to
TeX. 

Ryacas contains 8 different R interfaces to yacas.
Ryacas allows one to send R expressions,
unprocessed yacas strings and certain other R
objects to a separate yacas process from R and get
back the result.  It also has facilities for
manipulating yacas strings and R expressions
destined for yacas processing.
